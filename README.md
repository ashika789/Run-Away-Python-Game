Run Away
Project By: Ashika Ganesh


	The game of Run away is a quick and fast paced game that involves the main player, AKA the "hero" who has to run away from the ghosts that continuously fall in his path. The user who plays the game can use the arrow keys, the aswd keys, or the mouse(which is automatically centered to match the hero at the start of the game if you do decide to use the mouse). 
	A running tab of the score is kept per session. If the player gets a higher score than the round before, the top score is modified to keep a running track. 
	Also, cheats have been implemented. If the "z" key is pressed, the ghosts that fall will go in the reverse motion off the top of the screen. This helps in testing for the programmer and adds a fun little twist to the game. Also, when the "x" key is pressed, the ghosts will fall slower than usual and allow for the player to still move at the same rate, but with the ghosts as a slower rate. However, avoid using the z and x key as that is considered cheating in the game!
	The ghosts and the hero player are photoshopped accordingly to remove any backgrounds and create a transparent background layer for better gaming.


My program uses pygame which can be found here: http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml

On a mac, download the first link which is a 2.7 32 bit macosx 10.3 dmg file
If running from terminal window, call the file by changing directories into my folder titled "runaway" and then typing:
python2.7-32 runaway.py

Otherwise, open the runaway.py file in sublime2 texteditor and hit command-B and it will open up pygame and you will be able to view the file.
